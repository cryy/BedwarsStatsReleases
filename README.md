# What is BedwarsStats?

BedwarsStats is a program to be used alongside Minecraft on the Hypixel network. It helps you see bedwars stats of whoever you want and of people in your lobby. It does this efficiently by polling minecraft logs non-intrusively - allowing you to run alongside any client you want.
